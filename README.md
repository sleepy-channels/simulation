# Sleepy Channels simulation

An implementation to conduct the simulation experiments of Sleepy Channels.

## Usage:

- Install Python >= 3.7.3
- Install dependencies (check requirements.txt)
- execute experiment1.py to get the results of the watchtower simulation
- execute experiment2.py to get the results of the simulation evaluation how many channels are at risk 
(set ln = True to investigate the Lightning Network and ln = False to investigate Sleepy Channels)
- execute stats.py to get some information about the LN snapshot
- inspect stdout output for the results
